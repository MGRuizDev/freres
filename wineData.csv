Purple fruit juiciness is balanced by a sharp licorice edge, framed by judicious acidity and tannins.",Faith,89,39.0,California,California,California Other,Red Blend,Aver Family Vineyards
774,Italy,"Aromas of underbrush, black fruit, toast and espresso lead the nose on the blend of Sangiovese and 15% Malvasia Nera. The palate is still resting heavily on its oak, showing coffee, coconut, vanilla and mocha, along with dried black cherry, prune and clove. The raspy tannins need to soften up but the fruit richness is already drying up.",I Sodi di San Niccolò,89,90.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Castellare di Castellina
775,Portugal,"This is a serious, wood-aged wine whose ripe fruits are dominated at the moment by heavy toast flavors. The fruit does offer weight and good potential, making it a structured, dark wine that is beginning to suggest a juicy future. Drink from 2017.",Alma Grande Reserva,89,18.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Velhas
776,Portugal,"This is a herbal, earthy wine with as many tannins as fruit at this stage. That gives it a dense, dusty texture that seeps into the ripe, sweet plum flavors. With the wood giving an extra push of richness as well as spice, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.",D. Fuas Reserva,89,7.0,Terras do Dão,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Velhas
777,Portugal,"To judge by the weight of the bottle, this is regarded as an important wine by the producer. The wine inside is attractive and fruity, ripe with berry fruits and considerable freshness. The tannins give the power for the bottle, dry and dense at this young stage. Drink from 2017.",Magna Carta Reserva,89,17.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Velhas
778,Chile,"Briny aromas of bell pepper, jalapeño and canned pea are green-leaning but not overly vegetal. This has a round mouthfeel and ample body to absorb the wine's acidity, while flavors of celery, bell pepper, lime and tangerine come with a strong grassy accent and a persistent, briny tasting finish.",Justo,89,17.0,Leyda Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Claro
779,France,"This is a blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier (CSV). From estate vineyards in the Cahors region, it is a young wine, still developing its potentially aromatic character, fragrant acidity and rich pineapple and red apple flavors. Hold this wine and drink from late 2016.",CSV,89,20.0,Southwest France,Côtes du Lot,,White Blend,Clos Troteligotte
780,Italy,"This opens with aromas of toast, weedy underbrush and tobacco. The palate offers stewed plum marinated in spirits, anisette and coffee but not much fruit richness. Bracing tannins give it an astringent finish.",,87,50.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Corte dei Venti
781,Italy,"Pretty aromas of violet, rose and wild berry lead the nose. The bright but rather lean palate offers raw red berry, peppercorn and saline together with notes of dried sage. Astringent tannins create an abrupt finish.",Tradizione,87,87.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Tenuta Vitanza
782,US,"Aromas are dominated by oak with accents of vanilla, cocoa and woodspice along with cranberries, rose hips, herbs and raspberries. The palate is elegant with herb and cherry flavors that lead to a tart, cranberry-filled finish.",Copeland Vineayard,87,28.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Two Mountain
783,Italy,"Warm and robust, this has aromas of underbrush, spiced plum, grilled sage, leather and a balsamic note. The tightly wound palate offers dried berry, fig, menthol and licorice alongside super-astringent tannins and the heat of alcohol. A note of roasted coffee bean signals the close.",Firma Riserva,87,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Tenuta Vitanza
784,US,"Though just five years old, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot already seems quite tired, with notes of leather, dried red fruit and mushroom taking the lead. It has a pleasing, silky feel but the tart fruit flavors seem past their prime.",Intrepide,87,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ott & Murphy
785,France,"Big, fresh and juicy, this is a bright and forward wine. Attractive smoky tannins are layered with fresh acidity and black currant flavors. The wine is already attractive, although there are enough tannins for it to age. Drink from 2017.",,87,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Gazin Rocquencourt
786,France,"This wine is all fruit, crisp and with plenty of herbaceousness. A smoother character comes from the Sémillon in the blend that also gives richness. The wood aging shows only lightly, leaving fruitiness at the end.",,87,,Bordeaux,Graves,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Haut Selve
787,France,"Produced from young vines, this is the third wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. As such, it is very accessible with its ripe, red exuberant fruits. The tannins are in the background, giving the necessary structure to a wine that will age quickly. Drink from 2017.",Les Hauts de Larrivet Haut-Brion,87,35.0,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Larrivet Haut-Brion
788,France,"The dryness and tannins of this wine are on the outside. Inside it has plenty of juicy fruit, sweet acidity and black plum flavors. Put the two together and this ripe wine offers plenty of potential. Drink from 2019.",,87,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Luchey-Halde
789,France,"Hugely ripe Merlot is at the core of this rich wine. It is opulent, rounded and packed with dark plum-juice flavors. It verges on too much, too rich and too generous. What redeems it is the Bordeaux structure and final dry aftertaste.",Dame de Coeur,87,30.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Supérieur,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Peyfaures
790,US,"Nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine is perfumed in lavender and awash in juicy red cassis. The acidity is medium to high, while the tannins are rough and chewy, suggesting the need for assimilation time.",Serres Ranch,87,28.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Highway 12
791,Italy,"The nose isn't very expressive, but the palate offers mature blackberry, dried cherry, ground pepper, espresso and anise alonside assertive, astringent tannins. The dried fruit shows the heat of the vintage so best to drink soon.",Greppicante,87,20.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri,,Red Blend,I Greppi
792,US,"Oodles of black cherry and boysenberry fill the aromas and flavors of this bold but not-too-big wine. The rich, ripe fruit shows right away in the nose, and continues on the palate but gets reined in a bit (in a good way) by a firm texture created by good acidity and tannins.",,87,18.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Primitivo,Drytown
793,US,"Extremely fruity and rich, this stops just short of sweetness while delivering delicious cherry, mixed berry and plum flavors with just a touch of tannin and acidity to keep it fresh. It is quite full bodied and ready to drink now.",Syzygy,87,32.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Red Blend,Entropy Cellars
794,US,"This 100% varietal wine offers aromas of fresh-ground coffee, chocolate, herbs and plum along with barrel accents. It's soft in feel with an elegant styling, trailing toward the finish.",Canoe Ridge Vineyard,87,28.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Chateau Ste. Michelle
795,France,"The 60% Cabernet in the blend gives a dark fruit character. At this young stage, the wood aging still dominates with its burnt toast and chocolate character. For the future, while the wine will be dry, it also has plenty of fresh fruit. Drink from 2018.",,87,,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Taffard de Blaignan
796,US,This single-vineyard wine offers wild blueberry with vanilla and herb accents. It's full bodied and high-octane in feel with the flavors running straight down the fairway.,Cockburn Ranch Vineyard,87,26.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,College Cellars
797,US,"Grass and gooseberry are prominent on the nose and palate in this crisp SB, bright in dialed-high acidity. That sense of vibrant freshness mellows somewhat midway through the wine, allowing it to finish with a lushness on the tongue.",Estate,87,32.0,California,Calistoga,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Coquerel Family Wine Estates
798,US,"Generous sweet-tasting oak flavor coats the fresh plum and red cherry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. It has a broad, velvety texture, and shows good balance between ripeness, acidity and firm tannins. It finishes with a soft touch.",Bogle Vineyards,87,11.0,California,California,California Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bogle
799,US,"This wine hails from Lawrence and Antoine Creek vineyards and was barrel-fermented in new French oak before being moved to stainless steel. It starts out quite reduced and then opens to show notes of peach, pear and mineral. It's rounded and lightly oily in feel, tapering on the back half.",Reserve Nellie Mae,87,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Rhône-style White Blend,Cairdeas
800,US,"Tech sheets hint at Stagecoach Vineyard being involved somehow in this Syrah, a chewy expression of coconut, smoke and game around a dense, concentrated body and well-integrated tannins. The finish is all about mocha.",Lot 423,87,19.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Cameron Hughes
